//! Static and dynamic plugins.
//!
//! Plugins are an essential part of Alumet, as they provide the
//! [`Source`](crate::pipeline::Source)s, [`Transform`](crate::pipeline::Transform)s and [`Output`](crate::pipeline::Output)s.
//!
//! # Plugin lifecycle
//! Every plugin follow these steps:
//!
//! 1. **Metadata loading**: the Alumet application loads basic information about the plugin.
//! For static plugins, this is done at compile time (cargo takes care of the dependencies).
//!
//! 2. **Initialization**: the plugin is initialized, a value that implements the [`Plugin`] trait is created.
//! During the initialization phase, the plugin can read its configuration.
//!
//! 3. **Start-up**: the plugin is started via its [`start`](Plugin::start) method.
//! During the start-up phase, the plugin can create metrics, register new pipeline elements
//! (sources, transforms, outputs), and more.
//!
//! 4. **Operation**: the measurement pipeline has started, and the elements registered by the plugin
//! are in use. Alumet takes care of the lifetimes and of the triggering of those elements.
//!
//! 5. **Post start-up**: [`post_pipeline_start`](Plugin::post_pipeline_start) is called with
//! arguments that allow to interact with the running measurement pipeline (which is not possible
//! in `start`, since the pipeline is not fully constructed nor started at this point).
//!
//! 5. **Stop**: when the pipeline is stopped, the elements registered by the plugin are stopped and dropped.
//! Then, [`stop`](Plugin::stop) is called.
//!
//! 6. **Drop**: like any Rust value, the plugin is dropped when it goes out of scope.
//! To customize the destructor of your static plugin, implement the [`Drop`] trait on your plugin structure.
//! For a dynamic plugin, modify the `plugin_drop` function.
//!
//! # Static plugins
//!
//! A static plugin is a plugin that is included in the Alumet measurement application
//! at compile-time. The measurement tool and the static plugin are compiled together,
//! in a single executable binary.
//!
//! To create a static plugin in Rust, make a new library crate that depends on:
//! - the core of Alumet (the `alumet` crate).
//! - the `anyhow` crate
//!
//! To do this, here is an example (bash commands):
//! ```sh
//! cargo init --lib my-plugin
//! cd my-plugin
//! cargo add alumet anyhow
//! ```
//!
//! In your library, define a structure for your plugin, and implement the [`rust::AlumetPlugin`] trait for it.
//! ```no_run
//! use alumet::plugin::{rust::AlumetPlugin, AlumetPluginStart, ConfigTable};
//!
//! struct MyPlugin {}
//!
//! impl AlumetPlugin for MyPlugin {
//!     fn name() -> &'static str {
//!         "my-plugin"
//!     }
//!
//!     fn version() -> &'static str {
//!         "0.1.0"
//!     }
//!
//!     fn default_config() -> anyhow::Result<Option<ConfigTable>> {
//!         Ok(None)
//!     }
//!
//!     fn init(config: ConfigTable) -> anyhow::Result<Box<Self>> {
//!         // You can read the config and store some settings in your structure.
//!         Ok(Box::new(MyPlugin {}))
//!     }
//!
//!     fn start(&mut self, alumet: &mut AlumetPluginStart) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//!         println!("My first plugin is starting!");
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//!
//!     fn stop(&mut self) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//!         println!("My first plugin is stopping!");
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Finally, modify the measurement application in the following ways:
//! 1. Add a dependency to your plugin crate (for example with `cargo add my-plugin --path=path/to/my-plugin`).
//! 2. Modify your `main` to initialize and load the plugin. See [`Agent`](crate::agent::Agent).
//!
//! # Dynamic plugins

//! WIP
