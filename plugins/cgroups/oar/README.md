# OAR plugin

The `oar` plugin gathers measurements about [OAR](https://oar.imag.fr/) jobs.

## Requirements

- A node with OAR installed and running. Both OAR 2 and OAR 3 are supported ([config required](#configuration)).
- Both cgroups v1 and cgroups v2 are supported. Some metrics may not be available with cgroups v1.

## Metrics

Here are the metrics collected by the plugin's sources.

|Name|Type|Unit|Description|Resource|ResourceConsumer|Attributes|
|----|----|----|-----------|--------|----------------|----------|
|`cpu_time_delta`|Delta|nanoseconds|time spent by the pod executing on the CPU|`LocalMachine`|`Cgroup`|see below|
|`cpu_percent`|Gauge|Percent (0 to 100)|`cpu_time_delta / delta_t` (1 core used fully = 100%)|`LocalMachine`|`Cgroup`|see below|
|`memory_usage`|Gauge|Bytes|total pod's memory usage|`LocalMachine`|`Cgroup`|see below|
|`cgroup_memory_anonymous`|Gauge|Bytes|anonymous memory usage|`LocalMachine`|`Cgroup`|see below|
|`cgroup_memory_file`|Gauge|Bytes|memory used to cache filesystem data|`LocalMachine`|`Cgroup`|see below|
|`cgroup_memory_kernel_stack`|Gauge|Bytes|memory allocated to kernel stacks|`LocalMachine`|`Cgroup`|see below|
|`cgroup_memory_pagetables`|Gauge|Bytes|memory reserved for the page tables|`LocalMachine`|`Cgroup`|see below|

### Attributes

The measurements produced by the `slurm` plugin have the following attributes:
- `job_id`: id of the OAR job.
- `user_id`: id of the user that submitted the job.

The **cpu** measurements have an additional attribute `kind`, which can be one of:
- `total`: time spent in kernel and user mode
- `system`: time spent in kernel mode only
- `user`: time spent in user mode only

## Augmentation of the measurements of other plugins

The `oar` plugin adds attributes to the measurements of the other plugins.
If a measurement does not have a `job_id` attribute, it gets a new `involved_jobs` attribute, which contains a list of the ids of the jobs that are running on the node (at the time of the transformation).

This allows to know, for each measurement, which job was running at that time.
For the reasoning behind this feature, see [issue #209](https://github.com/alumet-dev/alumet/issues/209).

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to configure this plugin.
Put the following in the configuration file of the Alumet agent (usually `alumet-config.toml`).

```toml
[plugins.oar]
# The version of OAR, either "oar2" or "oar3".
oar_version = "oar3"
# Interval between each measurement.
poll_interval = "1s"
# If true, only monitors jobs and ignore other cgroups.
jobs_only = true
```
